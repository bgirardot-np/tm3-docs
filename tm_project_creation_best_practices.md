# TM Project Creation Best Practices

The following provide sample instructions related to creating best practices that could be used in the Instruction section:

* "Clip project areas to match imagery as much as possible"
* "Large scale efforts that span multiple Projects in the Tasking Manager should include one new mapper per specific project. The project should be pre-evaluated to be easy, with no alignment or imagery issues and buildings only. All new mappers should be directed to these projects. It also allows the  validators to know what project in an overall effort they can go to review new mappers work and what they have identified as the most critical time"
