Buildings
=======
The following provide sample instructions on mapping buildings that could be used in the Instruction section:

* Please accurately outline all the buildings you can find. The outline should be for the full size of the building even if it is partly covered by trees in the imagery.
* Most buildings are rectangular, after drawing the outline, **use the 's' key in the iD web editor to "square" the corners**.
* For circular buildings there is the 'o' key in the iD editor to create a circular structure.
* Many buildings are very close, but do not actually touch each other, try to map them close to each other without letting them connect or share nodes with each other, roads or residential area outlines. In the iD web editor, holding down the "alt" key will keep nodes of "snapping" to each other and accidentally connecting.
* In the iD web editor, the first time you map a building you will use the "Building Features" category and then at the top of the list select "Building" again, this is the most generic building tag we can use as we almost never can tell the more specific use of any building from imagery alone.

**If you have personal knowledge of a building**, please add that information to the building, like the name or type of building (hospital, school, gas station, etc)
