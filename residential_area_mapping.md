Residential Areas
==============
The following provide sample instructions on mapping residential areas that could be used in the Instruction section:

* "Please draw one large area outline around groups of buildings and tag them **landuse=residential**"
* "About five or more buildings can be outlined as a landuse=residential area" 
* "Please keep the outline close to buildings and do not include a lot of farmland or forest"
* "When to draw the residential area outline takes some judgement, but when in doubt, draw an outline around the settlement and ask for feedback on your work"
