Residential Areas
==============

* Please draw one large area outline around groups of buildings and tag them **landuse=residential**
* About 5 or more buildings can be outlined as a landuse=residential area. 
* Do your best to keep the outline close to buildings and not include a lot of farmland or forest.
* When to draw the residential area outline takes some judgement, but when in doubt, draw an outline around the settlement.
