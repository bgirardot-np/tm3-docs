Project Specific Mapping Notes
=========================
* Many of these squares will already be partially or fully mapped, map in more if needed or fix up the existing mapping, or just mark it "Done" if it is already complete.
* Please connect up roads that are not connected to the main network or nearby roads.
* Please disconnect roads that are attached to landuse=residential areas and draw them into the settlements and connect them to other roads that enter the settlements
* **Existing mapping does not match imagery** - This happens in some areas. Use the Bing imagery, but adjust it so it aligns with the existing mapping, then continue mapping. Please leave a comment in the Tasking Manager when you mark done/stop mapping to say you adjusted the imagery.

* Waterways are challenging in this area, more need to be mapped, but please only map the streams and rivers
* Many of the buildings are round huts. In the iD editor draw a 3 pointed triangle the size of the hut, then select it, hit the 'o' key and it will turn round. Tag it a building and then you can copy/paste it to other huts of the same size quickly.
