Project Specific Mapping Instructions
=========================
* The following provides several examples of instructions that could be used in the TM:
* 
* "Many of the squares in a project may already be partially or fully mapped. In this case map more if needed or fix up the existing mapping. Mark it "Done" in the Tasking Manager (TM) if the square is already complete"
* "Connect or join roads that are not connected to the main network or nearby roads. Roads that are near to each other but not connected may create validation errors. In addition, connected roads improve map routing"
* "Disconnect roads that are attached (overlap?) to landuse=residential areas. Draw them into the settlements and connect them to other roads that enter the settlements"
* **Existing mapping does not match imagery** - "Use the Bing imagery but adjust so it aligns with the existing mapping then continue mapping. Please leave a comment in the Tasking Manager when you mark done/stop mapping to say you adjusted the imagery. Also note this in your changeset. The following link demonstrates how to do this in iD: [Animated GIF how to adjust background imagery in iD](https://goo.gl/photos/77w8e1HjcEXPJEoL9)"
* "Waterways are challenging in this area and more need to be mapped but only map the streams and rivers"
* "Many of the buildings in this project are round huts. In the iD editor draw a 3 pointed triangle the size of the hut, then select it, hit the 'o' key and it will create a round outline indicating a hut. Tag it a building. You can the use this entry on other huts of the same size quickly by copying/pasting"
