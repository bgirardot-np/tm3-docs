# This Book: HOTOSM Tasking Manager Default Instruction Set

This is a gitbook repository focused on collaborative editing to arrive at a community consensus on a very good set of default Tasking Manager project instructions.

The Chapters in the book are organized around different mapping object types, e.g., building mapping instructions, road mapping instructions, general mapping instructions, etc.

Hopefully there is a sub chapter level that I can use to have the actual text of the proposed instructions.

This full default set of instructions will be made available at project creation time and Project Managers can just select they ones they like or none at all. 

Our goal is consistent, good instructions that are default so we are confident with the best set of instructions available at project creation by doing nothing.

This will also support translation. If Project Managers just use the defaults, it will be added in at least 5 languages.
