# **This Book: HOTOSM Tasking Manager Default Instruction Set**

This is a gitbook repository focused on collaborative editing to arrive at a community consensus on a very good set of default Tasking Manager project instructions as well as generate documentation for the Tasking Manager 3.0.

The Chapters in the book are organized around different mapping object types, e.g., building mapping instructions, road mapping instructions, general mapping instructions, etc.

This full default set of instructions will be made available at project creation time and Project Managers can just select they ones they like or none at all. 

Our goal is consistent, good instructions that are entered by default so we are confident with the best set of instructions available at project creation.

This will also support translation. If Project Managers just use the defaults, it will be added in at least 5 languages. It also provides an easily printable PDF version of these instructions or a subset of these instructions in at least 5 languages.
