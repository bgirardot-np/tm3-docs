# **This Book: HOTOSM Tasking Manager Default Instruction Set**

This is a GitBook repository focused on collaborative editing to arrive at a community consensus on an improved set of default Tasking Manager project instructions as well as generate documentation for Tasking Manager 3.0.

The chapters in the book are organized around different mapping object types, e.g., building mapping instructions, road mapping instructions, general mapping instructions, and so on.

A full default set of instructions will be made available at project creation time and Project Managers can just select then copy and paste any of the defaults of their choice. 

Our goal is to create consistent and high quality instructions that are entered by default to ensure that the best set of instructions available when the project is created. In turn, this will also support translation. If project managers use the default set of instructions the TM will provide for translation in a minimum of five languages. GitBook also provides an easily printable PDF version of these instructions or a subset in these five languages.
