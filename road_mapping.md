Roads and Paths
==============
* Please map roads and major paths as completely as possible by connecting them to the main road networks where ever possible.
* Very short segments that do not connect to anything should not be mapped.
* Short segments of a road or path that you cannot see through the trees but seem very likely to exist should be mapped to keep the road complete
* Try and map a little beyond your task square so the person who maps the task square next to yours can easily connect them.
* Always connect roads to other roads where they meet and never end roads on Residential area polygon edges.

You will most often use the following road classifications (JOSM):

* **highway=unclassified** - This is for roads that a vehicle with 4 wheels could travel on that connect small villages and settlements
* **highway=residential** - These are roads that are in settlements that only are used for access to houses and buildings. 
* **highway=track** - This is for roads that a 4 wheel vehicle or farm tractor could travel on and only lead to farm fields or forests. They do not connect settlements.
* **highway=path** - This is for small paths that a 4 wheeled vehicle could not travel on and are usually used by people on foot or 2 wheeled vehicles. They may or may not connect settlements or lead to farm fields. Only map the major paths that connect to settlements or other roads.

You will most often use the following "Road Features" and "Path Features" (iD Web Editor):

* **Minor/Unclassified** - This is for roads that connect small villages and settlements
* **Residential Road** - These are roads that are in settlements but only are used for access to houses and buildings.
* **Unmaintained Track Road** - This is for roads that only lead to farm fields or forests. They do not connect settlements or residential areas.
* **Path** - This is for small paths that are usually used by people on foot or 2 wheeled vehicles. They may or may not connect settlements or lead to farm fields. Only map the major paths that connect to settlements or other roads.
