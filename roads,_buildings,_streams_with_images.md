The following provide sample instructions on projects under discussion that could be used in the Instruction section:

"IMPORTANT: do not map any feature that appears completely destroyed"**

**"Note on interpreting this imagery**: the scene used is this task is from 10 October 2016 (change date as necessary) and was captured a few days after the hurricane (change nature of disaster as necessary) impact. Please be cautious when interpreting this imagery and use zoom levels up to Z=20 to inspect details. Many buildings have been completely destroyed and will therefore usually appear as white/gray rubbles. Most of the tall and exposed vegetation in this area has also collapsed and you will notice many tree trunks laying flat on the ground"

**"Positional accuracy**: you may notice a shift between this imagery and some existing OSM features. When inspecting this WorldView 3 scene it appears on average to line up with previous Bing imagery. A few HOT projects from 2015 that were in some of the same areas used imagery that had a significant offset. The same offset is present in the "Vintage" layer recently offered by DigitalGlobe for tracing. Please use your best judgment and compare other image sources when modifying objects"

# Roads
* Please add or update any track and road. Because of the collapsed vegetation many tracks are now visible. Please use your best judgment for classification and *highway=unclassified* if you are unsure.

# Buildings
* Many buildings have already been mapped in this area. Please **do not delete them** even if they appear destroyed or non existing in the current imagery.
* Map all buildings not yet mapped only when you can see a clear geometry resembling that of a man-made structure/building.  
![ht - buildings well defined](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10201533/19634628/75db0836-9971-11e6-9460-6817f52e41f7.gif)  
* Damage from the hurricane (change type of disaster as necessary) may have affected the shape of buildings or ripped their roofs off. Please map them as long as you can decide that a building was/is there (e.g. showing standing walls that define interior space).  
![ht - missing roof](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10201533/19634644/894e91c6-9971-11e6-81b0-ebaa951ab6e4.gif)
* Move existing buildings that you can clearly see offset to match the current imagery.

* When you are unsure, please do not move or edit any existing feature.
* Please **SQUARE all buildings** (shortcut key 'S' in iD editor and 'Q' in JOSM)

# Residential Areas
* Please update all existing residential area polygons to match the current imagery.

# Streams
* Please update all streams to match the current imagery. Because of collapsed vegetation many streams are now easier to interpret from imagery.
